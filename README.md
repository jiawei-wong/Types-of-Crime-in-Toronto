# Types of Crime in Toronto

## Overview of Paper
This paper explores the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on crime rates in 2020. The crime statistics used are the Victims of Crime dataset pulled from the Toronto Open Data portal. Crime rates have been increasing from 2014 to 2019 but faced a sudden decrease in 2020. In this analysis, we find that the pandemic alongside other factors such as the increase of police power abuse contribute to the overall decrease of crimes. Additionally, after breaking down the types of crime that contribute this overall crime statistics, we find that certain types of crime contributed more than others in the reduction of crime in Toronto.
